roman_polytheism:0 "Iovian"
roman_polytheism_religion_desc:0 "Iovianism, named after "Iovis", an alias of Iuppiter, the Roman King of Gods, is the reformed denomination of the traditional polytheistic faith of the ancient Romans and the old Roman Empire, which was abandoned following the rise of Christianity.\nAs the once great empire kept declining after the adoption of Christendom, a lot of Romans started considering Christianity as the reason of empire's defilement, and decided to turn back to the old faith following the awakening of Roman ethnic consciousness. As the result, the traditional Roman faith was reformed into Iovianism, which is largely philosophically backed by Iamblichean Platonism. Iovianists differ from Hellenists on religious language, allusions and the theories of worship, and they also adopt a number of Christian traditions such as hierarchical institution of the church and proselytic practice."
