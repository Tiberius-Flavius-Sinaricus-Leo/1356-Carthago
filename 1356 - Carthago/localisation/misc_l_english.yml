They claim that many lower members of the nobility are disregarding the peace and law of the land, using their position of power and the lands they hold to take up unreasonable tolls and taxes for traders passing by. Some are even said to attack and waylay merchants, robbing or extorting them of their money.\nRepresentatives of the [Root.GetAdjective] $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ now claim that the economic development of our country is held back by these excesses. The [Country.GetSenatoresName] on the other hand argue that they are simply charging reasonably for the use of their roads property. Some are willing to give the state a part of the share they take."

string_start_title_romania_africana:0 "The Romans in Africa"
string_start_romania_africana:0 "After the catastrophic defeat of Hieromyces against Muslims in AD 636, the remainings of §YRoman Empire§ had been torn apart, including the once united §YAfrica Minor§. Through the endeavour of Flavius Iulianus, the Exarchus of Africa under the Eastern Roman rule at the time, the territory of once Provincia Africa Proconsularis, including the city of §YCarthago§, was successfully defended against the Arabs. Since then, the Romans in Africa have managed to survive from the invasions launched by African Muslims, one after another. Meanwhile, the Roman Africa, officially acknowledged as Exarchatus Africae by Constantinopolitanians, had been nominally under the control of the §YEastern Roman Empire§ for a long time, although the connection between §YCarthago§ and §YConstantinopolis§ kept declining since the Roman Africa had become an exclave. When a Jihad against Carthago was launched, the African Romans usually had to fight against the invading muslims themselves, without support from their nominal Greek-Speaking Imperatores at Constantinopolis, who were probably busy playing their coup d'etate games behind the Theodosian Walls at the moment. \n\nThe fragile connection between the §YRomani Africani§ and the §YConstantinopolitani§ was somehow managed to be maintained until the beginning of the 13th century - although the decline of this connection was greatly accelerated during the reign of Angeloi - the Germanic Crusaders, persuaded by Venetians, launched attacks unexpectedly on §YConstantinopolis§ and successfully took the city, resulted the collapse of the Eastern Empire, and so the nominal affiliation of §YCarthago§ to §YConstantinopolis§.
