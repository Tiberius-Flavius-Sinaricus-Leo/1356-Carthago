While his successors could not hold the vast lands that he conquered, we have now managed to prove our legitimacy as true successors by holding Utriusque Romae in our hands, recovered the lands of old and obliterated the horrible mess that is neither holy, roman nor an empire. As such we shall finally reclaim the title as the one true Rome, or as we always have called ourselves - Imperium Romanum!"
