raf.1.t:0 "Just a Casual Stare on the Map..."
raf.1.d:0 "Somehow, you take a glance at the map, in which the current borders of us are marked, and you notice there is something unusual - the shape of our territories, it looks familiar to you, but you just can't remember that where you've seen it before..."
raf.1.a:0 "It just looks like the Kingdom of Vandals!!"
raf.2.t:0 "Urbs Aeterna Relecta"
raf.2.d:0 "So many years, Romans in Africa had this dream, that one day they could go back to their ancestors' hometown, pray around the Columna Traiani, go for a walk in Forum Romanum, or just climb up the Muri Aureliani, look into the distance or do something else... \n\nNow, here we are, we are back, back to our old capital, our homeland, back to Roma! We have fulfilled the Promise made by our ancestors when they were forced to leave, and we will stay, stay with the city of Romulus until the last one of us falls."
raf.2.a:0 "Roma Invicta!!"
raf.3.t:0 "The Byzantine Dilemma"
raf.3.d:0 "Although not always directly controlled, and all ties with the Eastern Empire were finally severed after the unanticipated fall of Constantinopolis in AD 1204, Romania Africana, or Exarchatus Africae as our land was called under the byzantine rule, had been tied with Eastern Romans for a long time - the days we would celebrate for their achievements, the days we would regret for their losses, are not so easy to wipe out from our memories. \n\nNow, as the Ottoman Turks at gates, it seems that our siblings in the east have come to their last moments. To help them or not, there's a decision to make......"
raf.3.a:0 "They need our help, and they will get it!"
raf.3.b:0 "Sure their God would have mercy on them..."
raf.4.t:0 "An Unexpected Proposal"
raf.4.d:0 "The Empire currently resides on the edge of the abyss, with the Turkish plotting to take our city. At this very moment, a diplomatic envy from Carthago has arrived and brought us an unexpected proposal, suggesting an alliance between the Empire and the Exarchatus Africae..."
raf.4.a:0 "Oh, our dear Roman brothers and sisters..."
raf.4.b:0 "We don't need those traitors' help!"
raf.5.t:0 "The Roman Alliance"
raf.5.d:0 "The Eastern Romans have agreed to establish an alliance with us. After so many years, the Romans from East and West are again united!"
raf.5.a:0 "Nothing could defeat us, not us united!"
raf.6.t:0 "Proposal denied"
raf.6.d:0 "The Constantinopolitanians have refused our proposal for the alliance. It seems that they would like to meet their doom by themselves..."
raf.6.a:0 "At least we have tried to lend a hand..."
raf.7.t:0 "Cirta Reclaimed"
raf.7.d:0 "Cirta, or Constantina as it was called after the rebuild by Constantinus Magnus, was once the capital city of the Berber kingdom of Numidia before it fell under Roman dominion during the time of Iulius Caesar. The city was repopulated by Romans later and became one of the most prosperous cities in Africa before the muslim invasion. \n\nThe restoration of Cirta puts us in an ideal position to expand back into old Numidian and Mauretanian regions once more."
raf.7.a:0 "Romani Invicti!!"
raf.8.t:0 "Tripolitania Reclaimed"
raf.8.d:0 "The disastrous defeat of Emperor Herakleios at Hieromyces in AD 636 caused the Saracens to take over the region of Tripolitania, one of the most important regions in Roman Africa. Now, however, the region is ours and so it shall remain forever more!"
raf.8.a:0 "Romani Invicti!!"
raf.9.t:0 "Italia Reclaimed"
raf.9.d:0 "Italia, the cradle of Romans, had fallen to Goths after the deposal of Romulus Augustulus in AD 476. Although it was once restored at great cost during the reign of Iustinianus I, most of Italia was soon lost to invading Langobardians following the death of Emperor Iustinianus. The whole region was later fully taken by Barbarians in AD 1050s.\n\nBut now, we have accomplished our revenge against those shameless robbers who have occupied our motherland for so many years, and finally, Italia is back in our hands, so it shall remain forevermore!"
raf.9.a:0 "Romani Invicti!!"
raf.10.t:0 "The Capital of Romans"
raf.10.d:0 "Carthago, the most prosperous city in Roman Africa, has always been the sanctuary of all Western Romans who had been exiled away from their hometwon. But now, Urbs Roma, our once glorious capital on the riverside of Tiberis, is again strongly held in our hands. It's time to make the decision, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! - Should we move our capital back to Roma, or stay in Carthago further?"
raf.10.a:0 "Roma is the righteous capital of all Romans, and it shall remain so..."
raf.10.b:0 "Carthago is our Roma."

utriusqueromae.3.t:0 "Imperium in Occidente"
utriusqueromae.3.d:0 "The unexpected death of Flavius Theodosius Augustus in AD 395 marked the end of an era, in which, for most of the time, the whole Mediterranean world was united and reigned, by the sole Roman Empire. His two sons, Arcadius and Honorius, were appointed as Co-Emperors of Romans, which resulted in the complete and final division of the Empire. Two Roman Emperors ruled the West and the East respectively since then – until the last Western Emperor, Flavius Iulius Nepos Augustus, was exiled from Ravenna, the capital of the Western Empire at the time, and later murdered by two of his generals at Dalmatia in AD 480.\n\nNow, as we, the Western Romans, have rerisen and restored the glories of our ancestors, it's legitimate for us to reclaim the lost diadem of Flavius Iulius Nepos, and proclaim the 'Renovatio Romanorum Occidentalium'!"
utriusqueromae.3.a:0 "It's better to ask the Eastern Romans for their recognition..."
utriusqueromae.4.t:0 "Imperium in Occidente"
utriusqueromae.4.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER TEXT"
utriusqueromae.4.a:0 "They don't need our recognition, in fact... [From.Monarch.GetName] and his predecessors had already shown that they are well-deserved to be recognized as the Western Emperors. Please bring my congratulations."
utriusqueromae.4.b:0 "There is only one Roman [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in this universe, and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is right in front of you!"
utriusqueromae.5.t:0 "Rise of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Romanorum Occidentalium"
utriusqueromae.5.d:0 "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! Our envoy back from [From.Capital.GetName] has brought us some heartening news – the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of the Eastern Romans had recognized Your Majesty as [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] Co-[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of the West!"
utriusqueromae.5.a:0 "Ave Roma!"
utriusqueromae.6.t:0 "Byzantine Dilemma"
utriusqueromae.6.d:0 "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], bad news from [From.Capital.GetName] – the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of the Eastern Romans had rejected our righteous request! [From.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] proclaimed that there should only be one Roman Emperor from the start to the end..."
utriusqueromae.6.a:0 "Alas..."
utriusqueromae.6.b:0 "We don't need those Greek-speaking Clowns' recognition anyway!!"
