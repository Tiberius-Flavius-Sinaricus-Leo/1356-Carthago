estate_senatores.1.d:0 "$MONARCH$ has allowed the [Country.GetSenatoresName] of $COUNTRY$ to grow too powerful and now they have made their move. Exercising the wide range of privileges and rights granted to them, they have effectively seized the reins of government and turned the $MONARCHTITLE$ into little more than their puppet."
estate_senatores.1.a:0 "We should have seen this coming..."
estate_senatores.1.a.tt:0 "[Root.GetName] will now be controlled by the [Country.GetSenatoresName]! until the §Y'Curtail the Senatores'§! decision is taken."
estate_senatores.2.t:0 "The [Country.GetSenatoresName] Curtailed"
estate_senatores.2.d:0 "We have managed to limit the influence of the [Country.GetSenatoresName] to tolerable levels. Their privileges have been revoked and their properties reduced. The [Country.GetSenatoresName] themselves have grudgingly agreed that the $MONARCHTITLE$ is the undisputable leader of this country and the stamp formerly used by the [Country.GetSenatoresName] in place of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] signature has been destroyed."
estate_senatores.2.a:0 "The $MONARCHTITLE$ is back in control."
estate_senatores.3.d:0 "In many cases local officials, appointed by our [Country.GetSenatoresName], consider it a perk of the job to be able to siphon parts of the local taxes and tributes into their own pockets.\nThe governor of [corrupt_governor.GetAreaName] seems to have crossed a line, however, as the local population in the area has risen in revolt due to his ill-concealed attempts to enrich himself from their hard-earned toil and sweat."
estate_senatores.3.a:0 "We must replace this governor at once to placate the locals."
estate_senatores.3.b:0 "We cannot tolerate such insubordination. Crush the rebels!"
